# Multi-classification-of-dental-diseases-using-x-ray-images
## Introduction
Dental disease diagnosis using X-ray images is a challenging task that requires
accurate and efficient classification. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise, they often suffer from
limitations such as overfitting, time consumption, and lower accuracy. To address
these issues, a deep transfer learning model based on the ResNet-50 architecture has
been developed to classify dental X-ray images into four disease categories: Cavity,
Fillings, Impacted Tooth, and Implant, achieving over 92% accuracy. This research
builds on state-of-the-art deep learning models like SqueezeNet, ResNet-50, and
EfficientNet-b0, which have proven effective in medical image classification. 
ResNet-50, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) known for its simplicity, is further
enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation to improve the
performance for dental image classification which allows for detailed analysis of
edentulous areas, identifying the condition of each tooth within the X-ray using
bounding boxes for disease localization. In conclusion, this optimized ResNet-50-
based model, leveraging transfer learning, proves to be highly effective in dental
diagnostics, reducing clinical workload while enhancing treatment outcomes.
